  - Accessibility and responsive design validation
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Bible content service search functionality (23 tests)
  - Database interaction testing
  - Search algorithm validation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Search Algorithm Features
1. **Relevance Scoring**:
   - Exact matches: 100 points
   - Word boundary matches: +15 points
   - Term at beginning: +10 points
   - All terms present: +20 points
   - Length penalty for very long verses: -5 points

2. **Search Term Processing**:
   - Supports quoted phrases: `"exact phrase"`
   - Multiple words: `word1 word2`
   - Mixed queries: `"exact phrase" additional words`

3. **Filtering Options**:
   - Multiple Bible versions simultaneously
   - Testament filtering (Old/New/All)
   - Specific book selection
   - Exact match vs fuzzy search

### Data Storage
- **Search History**: localStorage with automatic cleanup (50 item limit)
- **Saved Searches**: localStorage with metadata (timestamps, usage tracking)
- **Search Results**: In-memory with proper cleanup
- **IndexedDB Integration**: Efficient querying of downloaded Bible content

### Performance Considerations
- **Result Limiting**: Maximum 100 results displayed to user
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized IndexedDB collection filtering
- **Lazy Loading**: Search results rendered on-demand
- **Debounced Input**: Prevents excessive search operations

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 6.1**: Full-text search across downloaded Bible versions
✅ **Requirement 6.2**: Search results with book, chapter, and verse references  
✅ **Requirement 6.3**: Navigation to specific verses from search results
✅ **Requirement 6.4**: Search term highlighting in results
✅ **Requirement 6.5**: Offline search functionality for downloaded versions

### Additional Features Implemented
- Advanced search options (versions, books, testament filtering)
- Search history with persistent storage
- Saved searches with custom names
- Exact match vs fuzzy search options
- Search suggestions and auto-complete
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Full accessibility support
- Mobile-responsive design

## Testing Coverage
- **77 total tests** across all search functionality
- **100% pass rate** for all implemented features
- **Unit, Integration, and Component tests** covering:
  - Search algorithm accuracy
  - User interface interactions
  - Error handling scenarios
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Performance edge cases

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/views/SearchView.vue` - Main search interface component
- `src/composables/useSearch.ts` - Search state management composable
- `src/composables/__tests__/useSearch.test.ts` - Composable unit tests
- `src/views/__tests__/SearchView.test.ts` - Component tests
