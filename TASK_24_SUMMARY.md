- Search queries (anonymized)
- Bookmark actions (create, delete)
- Feature usage patterns
- PWA installation events
- Performance metrics
- Error occurrences

## Integration Points

### Main Application Integration
- Analytics and monitoring services initialized in `main.ts`
- Production-only activation to avoid development noise
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Security Requirements Compliance
- **Requirement 9.3**: Secure protocols and token management
  - HTTPS enforcement with HSTS headers
  - Secure JWT token handling in Supabase
  - Content Security Policy implementation
  
- **Requirement 9.4**: Encrypted connections
  - All API communications over HTTPS
  - Supabase connections encrypted
  - Service worker secure context requirements

## Production Readiness Features

### Performance Optimization

## Testing Recommendations

Before production deployment:
1. Run full test suite (`npm run test:all`)
2. Perform security audit (`npm run security:audit`)
3. Test PWA functionality offline
4. Verify analytics tracking in staging
5. Test deployment pipeline with staging environment
6. Validate all security headers are applied
7. Confirm RLS policies are working correctly

The production build and deployment setup is now complete and ready for deployment to a production environment.
